# Giving Talks

Hey! My name is [Oscar Hickman](/). I am a cosmology researcher at Durham University.

[Talks I have given](/talks).

<!--
If you are organizing a frontend related conference or meetup, I'd be happy to give a talk!

- I am currently only doing **in-person** talks.
- I would expect my travel and accommodation to be covered.
- For conferences outside of Schengen area, China, Singapore and Japan, I would need some assistance on the business visa application.

You can reach me out at [talks@antfu.me](mailto:talks@antfu.me). Looking forward to it!
